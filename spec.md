The goal of this repo is to create a *minimal* but *complete* implementation of a logic programming language in Rust which executes acording to Semantically Guided Goal-Sensitive Reasoning (SGGS).

The core interface should include a surface syntax for files declaring theories and for making queries to a CLI after importing or declaring the theory. This should also support a basic jupyter notebook kernel allowing this CLI and theory definitions to be used interactively in a notebook.
